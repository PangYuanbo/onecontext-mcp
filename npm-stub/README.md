# onecontext-mcp (npm stub)

This is a minimal **placeholder** package published to npm to reserve the name `onecontext-mcp`.

The actual MCP server lives in the scoped package:

- `@pangyuanbo/onecontext-mcp`

## Why

npm does not support private *unscoped* packages. Private publishing requires a scoped package (and an npm paid plan).

So we:

1) publish this stub as public to occupy `onecontext-mcp`
2) publish the real server as a scoped package (private/restricted if desired)

## Install (actual server)

See the main repo README.
